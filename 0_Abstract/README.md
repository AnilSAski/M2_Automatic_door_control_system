# Automatic door control system
The automatic door opening systems are used in commercial buildings, shopping malls, theatres, etc. These systems are used to open the door when a person comes near to the entrance of the door and closes it after he moves away from the door or after entering into the door. There are various kinds of sensors are available in the market to make such types of systems such as Radar sensors, PIR sensors, Infrared sensors, and Laser sensors, etc. This project uses a PIR sensor to open or close the door automatically which senses the infrared energy produced by the human body. When someone approaches the door, the IR energy sensed by the PIR sensor changes and activates the sensor to open and close the door automatically. Further, the signal sent to the microcontroller to control the door.
## Applications: 
Today automatic doors are a common sight. they are installed in Malls. Hotels.Hospitals. Commercial Establislhments. Banks. Office spaces.Post Offices.Garages.Rail Cars. Perimeter fencingBesidesbeing convenient to use. there are many other advantages as emmerated below:
### Advantages 
- Automatic doors provide hands free operations. hence they provide unparalleled access for elderly. divyang(handicapped) and those with small children.
- Automatic doors don't necessitate any human effort or force to perform their operation. It helps do away from the struggle and aggravations when it comes to opening a relatively heavier manual door.
- They are helpful for people carryng heavy packages, luggage or children.
- Automatic doors grant you the option to open the door manually as well. 
- Automatic doors are safe and provide convenient access they automatically stop closing if someone enters while the door is closing thereby ensuring safety and security of personnel 
- Automatic doors by virtue of beng automatic always close completely and properly.thereby ensuring safety from potential intruders (there are no accidental opened doors). This also means that one does not need to have additional locks or security systems un place to keep out or deter burglars and thieves from entering premises.
- The Automatic doors can also be accessed via a remote control from the outside.
- Automatic doors are easy to operate. They are quite sturdy and require minimal maintenance requirements. 
- Automatic doors also help conserve energy as they open only when passing-by traffic is near, andf close spontaneously. automatic doors thus easily conserve temperature inside premises. Thus. saving-up on electrieity costs.
- Two automatic doors installed 2-3 feet apart are generally used in High Security regions to prevent tailgating.
- Automatic doors made using fire-proof material are used in Hospitals. Hotels. Offices to block and prevent fire from spreading. 
- Additionally, using a remote-control device automatic doors can lock. unlock. open. half-open. close i.e. make the door operations very efficient.
- In order to further improve security, automatic doors can be titted with access control functions using bionmetric devices. 
- In large establishments like offices, big Malls -muitiple automatic doors are installed and managed using centralized security rooms this reduces the security costs of premises 
### Disadvantages 
- Automatic doors are more costly than manual garage doors. 
- Automatic doors require a one-time installation by trained door technician and regular maintenance and checkup which costs money.
- Automatic door repairs can be costly especially when some parts need to be replaced.
- Automatic doors are also more complex to clean since you also need to polish internal parts like springs and bolts to avoid the accumulation of rust. 
- In the unlikely scenario that the automatic door becomes faulty. one has to resort to manual operations. hence all automatic doors need to have handles etc. Also. if someone places an obstructive object in the door path - the door will malfunction
