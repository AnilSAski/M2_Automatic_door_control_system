# Automatic door control system
The automatic door opening systems are used in commercial buildings, shopping malls, theatres, etc. These systems are used to open the door when a person comes near to the entrance of the door and closes it after he moves away from the door or after entering into the door. There are various kinds of sensors are available in the market to make such types of systems such as Radar sensors, PIR sensors, Infrared sensors, and Laser sensors, etc. This project uses a PIR sensor to open or close the door automatically which senses the infrared energy produced by the human body. When someone approaches the door, the IR energy sensed by the PIR sensor changes and activates the sensor to open and close the door automatically. Further, the signal sent to the microcontroller to control the door.
